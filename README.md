# LGMVIP-TASK-1
TODO-LIST

This project is built on webpages for a virtual internship programme called "lets grow more" that offers web development internships.
Task 1 involved building a dynamic webpage for a to-do list, and I completed it using the HTML, JS, and CSS tools in the Visual Studio Code IDE.
